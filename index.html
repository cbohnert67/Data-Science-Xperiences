:point_right: Welcome Data Buddy :point_left:

This is home for Data Science eXperiences !

Practical learning experiences for the Data Science enthusiast.

You can look around and read about programming exercices, data stories and data science projects solved with Python.

Notebooks are written in :us: or  :fr:.

Note this project is an - ever - and - slowly- evolving work that I feed as a function of pass time.

:book: Happy reading & coding :book:
