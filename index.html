:point_right: Welcome Data Buddy :point_left:

This is home for Data Science eXperiences !

Practical learning experiences for the Data Science enthusiast.

These are practical problems, projects and challenges for your learning journey.

You can look around and read about them and try to solve them with Python.

Notebooks are written in :us:. Please read About section to better understand the organization of the collection.

Note this project is an - ever - and - slowly- evolving work that I feed as a function of pass time.

:book: Happy reading & happy problem solving :book:
